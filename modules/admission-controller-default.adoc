[id="admission-controller-default_{context}"]
= Default admission controllers

A set of default admission controllers are enabled in {product-title} {product-version}. These default admission controllers contribute to fundamental control plane functionality, such as ingress admission policy, xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-overcommit.adoc#nodes-cluster-resource-override_nodes-cluster-overcommit[cluster resource limit override] and quota policy.

Admission plug-ins are resource specific. As such, resources served by `openshift-apiserver` use a different admission chain.

[NOTE]
====
Default admission controller implementation may differ between {product-title} releases.
